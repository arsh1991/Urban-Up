## Urban Up - Hire a Contractor with just few simple clicks!

Urban Up helps you hire a contractor. It allows users to create, browse, and interact with professionals. It uses Ethereum Payments that allow a payer to submit payment for an open request, and specify a service deposit. Any user can then commit to do the work by submitting the deposit. The payer then has the choice to deduct or release parts of the ether held in the payment, depending on whether and how well the worker has done the work.

### Installation

Software required to run the project on a local web server. To get the access to ethereum node install the [metamask plugin](https://metamask.io/)

Download and unzip the project and run the following commands :

a ) npm install

b ) npm run dev
